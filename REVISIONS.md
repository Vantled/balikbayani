I have a new plan. Lets write this plan on @REVISIONS.md. My plan is to make the system mobile responsive and add a new user hierarchy for the applicants. For the applicants, they can only do or access the following:

- Login (Add a new register page for the user. The registration should include sending OTP through emails)
- Register
- Fillout Personal Information form on first login to get their information.
- Page that shows the status of their request and where they can start their application (they can choose if Direct Hire, Balik Manggagawa, Gov to Gov, Information Sheet). Use the create application form present on each pages (direct hire, balik manggagawa, gov to gov, information sheet) for gathering the data field.
- The user is limited to one application per module (1 direct hire, 1 bm, 1 gov to gov, 1 info sheet).
- After submission, their application will now be on the system just like how a staff submits a form.
- The user should only be limited to seeing their own information.
- The reference number (or the control no of the application) should be present after the submission.
