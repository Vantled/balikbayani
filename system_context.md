# BalikBayani - Digital File Management Web System
## Project Overview
BalikBayani is a digital file management and tracking system designed to modernize the filing process of migrant worker records in the Processing Division of the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW). The system aims to streamline document processing, enhance security, and improve overall operational efficiency. This system would be operated as a web app on browsers.

2. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Compare system performance against traditional manual processes
   - Evaluate using ISO 25010 software quality model
   - Measure and document efficiency improvements
   - Conduct user acceptance testing

3. **Security and Compliance**
   - Implement robust authentication mechanisms
   - Create comprehensive audit trail system
   - Ensure data confidentiality and integrity
   - Comply with ISO 25010 quality standards
